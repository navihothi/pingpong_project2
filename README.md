I enojoyed doing this project, it was really fun creating a classic pong game. As a class, I feel we did work together as a team but maybe not the same way as what was expected from us.

I had difficulties:
- writing the syntax for methods and functions for movements
- figuring out what classes relied on other classes and where i had to right the syntax for the movements
